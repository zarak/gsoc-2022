* Next meeting discussion points
** Git commit workflow
- Set upstream to GitLab and origin to my forked version on GitHub
- I'll create a repo on GitHub so that I can do project management without cluttering the Goal repo on GitLab
** DONE Pruning large files in .git cache
** Reword proposal summary
** Finalize milestones for phase 1
** How can I include Hasktorch as a dependency for Goal using nix?
- Workaround is to use the Hasktorch template and manually copy goal source code folder into directory
- Try packaging goal in nix and copying haskell skeleton template files to dir
