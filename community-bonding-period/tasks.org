The git cache seems to have large files - should these be pruned?

Find 10 largest blobs:
#+begin_src bash
git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/pack-7741dec2030092fba0aed6b804e03a9c8094c1c9.idx \
                                              | sort -k 3 -n \
                                              | tail -10
#+end_src

The large files are data files in the applications dir:
#+begin_src bash
git rev-list --objects --all | grep b50e4b6
#+end_src
