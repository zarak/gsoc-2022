I had to clear large files before I could push to the repo - i.e. history is rewritten
#+begin_src bash
bfg --strip-blobs-bigger-than 50M
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
#+end_src
*** TODO Write derivations for each =Goal= module

*** TODO Read GSoC roles and responsibilities page
** Notes
*** Clearing large files from git cache
The git cache seems to have large files - should these be pruned?

Find the 10 largest blobs.
#+begin_src bash
git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/pack-7741dec2030092fba0aed6b804e03a9c8094c1c9.idx \
                                              | sort -k 3 -n \
                                              | tail -10
#+end_src

The large files are data files in the applications dir.
#+begin_src bash
git rev-list --objects --all | grep b50e4b6
#+end_src
